# Daily.Planner
Daily planner for when you cannot trust yourself; 6am-11pm

After I was done with the time and hours, I used function getHeaderDate to grab the current header date. I then used the function saveReminders to localStorage to save the entry into the planner after refresh along with saveBtn at the bottom. Included is a preview:
